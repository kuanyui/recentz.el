# `recentz` - A KISS, minimalized replacement of built-in `recentf`
## Why

Because the behaviors of Emacs built-in `recentf` has frustrated me for over 10 years. I'm never able to understand what on earth it is doing.

## What

A simple and stupid recents list, without any confusing behaviors -- just do what you mean, like any other IDE or editor. (I've falled into self-doubt for years whenever thinking that I have to implement such feature for a text editor in 2024.)

### Characteristics

- Minimalized, no confusing behavior, no extra dependency (only relys on `cl-lib`). Fuzzy search is provided by Ido (Emacs built-in) or Helm (need installation).
- Never caches, even never stores anything in memory. (Everything are stored as a plaintext file in `~/.emacs.d/.recentz-data`.)
- Never loses any item after exiting Emacs. (Even an unexpected exit or crash)
- Always synchronized recents list between multiple Emacs instances.
- Always automatically removes items which is no longer existed in file system.
- Recorded lists: files / directories / projects (directories controlled by VC, ex: `git`)
<!--
- A minimalized alternative of `project-find-file` / `projectile-find-file` (the recently opened files will be on top of the list)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-x C-S-p") 'recentz-find-file-in-project)  ;; Optional. This feature requires external program `ag` (the_silver_searcher)
-->

> [!NOTE]
> 1. `Recentz` always check the availabiliy (via `file-exists-p`) of each items in the list (and remove the non-existent-anymore items), so it should be better to run on SSD if you set a large items amount limit.
> 2. On the other hand, the availability of the items opened via TRAMP will never be checked nor removed.

## Installation

```emacs-lisp
(require 'recentz)
(setq recentz-ignore-path-patterns '("/COMMIT_EDITMSG$" "~$" "/node_modules/"))

;; If you prefer (Emacs built-in) Ido
(global-set-key (kbd "C-x C-r") 'recentz-files)  ;; Add universal argument prefix "C-u" (that is "C-u C-x C-r") can open the recent TRAMP-opened files instead.
(global-set-key (kbd "C-x C-d") 'recentz-directories)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-x C-p") 'recentz-projects)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-x C-S-r") 'recentz-tramp-files)        ;; Optional, because it's equivalient to C-u C-x C-r
(global-set-key (kbd "C-x C-S-d") 'recentz-tramp-directories)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-x C-S-p") 'recentz-tramp-projects)

;; If you prefer Helm
(global-set-key (kbd "C-x C-r") 'helm-recentz-files)   ;; Add universal argument prefix "C-u" (that is "C-u C-x C-r") can open the recent TRAMP-opened files instead.
(global-set-key (kbd "C-x C-d") 'helm-recentz-directories)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-x C-p") 'helm-recentz-projects)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-x C-S-r") 'helm-recentz-tramp-files)         ;; Optional, because it's equivalient to C-u C-x C-r
(global-set-key (kbd "C-x C-S-d") 'helm-recentz-tramp-directories)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-x C-S-p") 'helm-recentz-tramp-projects)
```

> [!TIP]
> 1. Ido and Helm have different UI and searching behaviors, you can try both and choose the one you prefer.
> 2. You don't need to enable `ido-mode` nor `helm-mode` globally. `recentz` only use their minibuffer completion feature, for easily filtering candidates list.

You may also want to add `.recentz-data` into `.gitignore`, if you manage your `.emacs.d` via `git`:

```shell
cd ~/.emacs.d && echo ".recentz-data" >> .gitignore
```
